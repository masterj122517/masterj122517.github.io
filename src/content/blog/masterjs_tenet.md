I have read so many articles and watched so many videos, trying to find a way to make my life happier

I have been struggled for years to find a way to escape from the current environment. 

As i was going to give up. 

I read a [article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/58e5af6149f6) by [manateelazycat](https://manateelazycat.github.io/) and suddenly [George Hotz](https://github.com/geohot)'s thoughts came into my head

I knew today is the finally the day that i'm going to construct my tenet. 

Followings might change my life forever

inspired by [the early 28 years in my life](https://www.jianshu.com/p/58e5af6149f6) and [how to become a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) and [George Hotz](https://github.com/geohot) and the Modern Zen Poem

*To follow the path*  

*look to the master*  

*follow to the mast*er  

*walk with the mast*er  

*see through the ma*ster  

*become the master*  

1. Boredom and drudgery are evil.

2. Your happiness or pain is all because (Ideology struggles against the world)意识形态与世界做斗争, Follow your ideology

3. Helping Others in your way is good

4. Be hamble, Be peaceful, Follow the path of masters 

5. Ignore anybody/anything that's not important but bothers you  

6. Don't be sacred of failure

7. Be patient, writing code or apply the knowledge until you can understand it (if you can't create it, you can't understand it)

8. Treasure everything you have.

9. Question yourself and the world

10. Time is to waste

11. Fuck the world

Therefore, I conclude the 3 i must follow

***Boredom and drudgery are evil.***

***the happiness and pain are because my heart struggling against the world, I must follow my heart***

***Helping Others in your way is good***
