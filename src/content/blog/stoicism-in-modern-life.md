Stoicism isn't about suppressing emotions. It's about understanding what we can control and focusing our energy there.

## Core Principles

### The Dichotomy of Control

Some things are in our control, others are not. Focus only on what you can change.

### Memento Mori

Remember that you will die. This isn't morbid—it's liberating. It reminds us what truly matters.

### Amor Fati

Love your fate. Accept everything that happens as necessary and beneficial.

## Practical Application

### Morning Routine

Each morning, ask:
- What challenges will I face today?
- How can I respond virtuously?

### Evening Reflection

At night, reflect:
- Where did I succeed?
- Where did I fall short?
- How can I improve tomorrow?

## Daily Practice

Stoicism is a practice, not just philosophy. Like coding, it requires daily effort and refinement.
