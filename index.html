    <h1>WELCOME TO MY WONDERLAND</h1>
    <p style = "font-size: 20px;">Hello, My Name is MasterJ <br></p>
    <p>I'm a student in harbin university of science and technology</p>
    <p>here is my Github <a href="https://github.com/masterj122517" target="_blank" >masterj122517</a></p>
    <p>Personally, I'am a great Neovim enthusiast and A big fan of GNU/LINUX though im using mac now</p>
    <p>Right Now, Im trying to learn os and computer networking meanwhile trying to learn to write a website</p>
    <p>I like the word <b>passion</b> It makes me feel alive</p>
    <p>Since I am a C/C++ programmer, I know nothing about Web Dev, So I'll try my best to make this website looks nice</p>
    <p>BTW, i feel like learnig web dev is way easier than learn C/C++, It's kinda fun not going to lie</p>
    <p>But I don't have much ideas of web dev, I guess the most important is creativity</p>
    <p>I guess that's it, Maybe I'll use js and js framework to enhance this website</p>
    <p><i>i don't know :/</i></p>
