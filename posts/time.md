time flew fast

I started this blog 3 months ago.

Didn't expect that to happen

Quite Like This life style

I like the feeling of being the shining man

However, I have to learn to enjoy the peace, and the true happiness.

I've got everything i need to do anything i want

So there's only two things for me to do in the rest of 2025

1. Lose weight 

2. Find a job
