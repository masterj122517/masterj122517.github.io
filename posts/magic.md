When i was a kid, i was so obsessed with Magic.

Even got upset when i discover there is no magic in our planet.

However, recently, i realized that magic is real in real world.

It's called Programming.

If you think carefully, You will discover it's kind similor. 

| magic | programming |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| create things based on spell | create things based on theory |
| benefit people's life |  benefit people's life |
| need creativity, hard-working, and do real 'battles' to be good | need creativity, hard-working, and do real projects to be good |


So, I choose programming as my career and I decide to build something that really change people's life and change the current technology industry

Magic is real and i'm becoming a wizard
