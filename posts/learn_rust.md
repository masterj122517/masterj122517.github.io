I plan to learn rust.

It has been many years since i wrote my first "hello world" in C.

At First, I found programming is interesting, However, Due to the pressure of finding a job and other people's judgement, Programming seems not fun but pressure to me.

So, I plan to learn Rust to change that situation.

Why Rust? you might ask

First, Rust is not a market language in China, Not so many companies would use rust in production, So, Learning Rust is just for fun.

Second, I really love the idea of open source and Rust happened to be the most popular language in open source community.   

Third, I really hate CS courses, Don't get me wrong, I like compiler,OS, compiler, algorithms, However, When it turns to finding a job, It's not really that fun. Endless useless questions, pressure that given by myself 

I really hate my current self. 

However, I heard the prase "Time is to waste" from George Hotz, and "简单来说就是降低短期期望，养成工作和开源贡献日常化，日拱一卒。再简化到核心就是心态，但行好事莫问前程。" by [lazycat](https://manateelazycat.github.io/2025/06/09/work-and-open-source/)

I decided to fuck jobs, I'm going to do whatever i want

Exploring the uncertainty is interesting

I'm fan of diving and programming. So, I'm going to do whatever i want to do, fuck lifes, fuck money, fuck anybody who gives me pressure.

If you don't like it, fuck you too.

I only live once, I would like to live my life my own way.
