Here is the plan, I will use Doom Emacs for the rest of 2025. 

There is two main reasons why am i doing this instead of just build my own emacs config right now

1. I'm not really familiar with Emacs, I only know the basics of it. I don't know elisp and other stuff, i need time to get use to it.

2. I'm following my path in neovim (my-own-config -> LazyVim -> my-own-perfect-config)
I made my emacs config long time ago, i'm not really like it, so i decided to just follow the old path i have been through.

In this blog, I will keep updating what i learn from this journey and the fun that'm getting
