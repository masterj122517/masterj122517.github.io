# I been using neovim for many years 

I like vim motions i set my browser to behave like vim and even bind vim hjkl to macOS with karabiner-elements.

But Now, I use emacs.....

Let me explain....

I like neovim, i use it for almost five years and it's indeed my favorite code editor but i'm trying to build a unique coding experience. 

No matter what OS im in, i could always start a code editor and start coding.

right right right, I know i could just use vscode on windows.  

Vscode is cool, but lack of extensibility I like to use my *own* editor just like neovim.

As a code editor, neovim is top1 of course. 

But as a filemanager, terminal emulator, pdf reader, email client, rss feed reader, It's not that good.

Therefore, in case i will use different OS like Windows, Linux, macOS, I want to build a consistent experience among all those OS.

I used neovim in windows, not gonna lie, it's pretty bad experience. 

I like the idea of using one tool for everything. like raycast in macOS 

I don't want to use different filemanager, pdf reader, email client on different platforms, it's really not my way of doing things 

So, although i like tmux and sesh(which is a tmux tools), i decided to switch to a gui application which is emacs.

Don't get me wrong, i will still use neovim with tmux in macOS and Linux. 

All the effort i will be made, it's just i want to build my emacs config like my neovim and tmux experience on linux or macOS.

almost all my friends(including developer friends) use Windows, i'm sort of a Game Dev, I'll use Windows time to time. Building a unique multi-platform experience is really essential for me and really, i believe every editor or tools will die one day especially in the time of AI except vim and emacs. They have been through so many years with even growing popularity, therefore, it's not a really bad idea of spending time make me a great tool right.

And.......
Configure emacs and neovim is really fun..........
