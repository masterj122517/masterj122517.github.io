## Step1

### Fuck efficiency and break your tasks into small pieces.

## Step2

### Fuck others, you are the one who takes control, think those annoying people as dog shit,  you don't want to touch dog shit don't you? 

## Step3 

### Trust yourself, You are good, you are smart, you have skills, you can do anything if you try hard, you can understand anything if you try hard.


## Step4 (most important)

### Don't fall into perfectism, Don't give up when you think you can't finishing your job like a god, you are a human but a nice one. 

## let's summarize:

    If you don't care about others, you wouldnt be able to be distracted.
