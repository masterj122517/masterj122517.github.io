what's good fellas I been watching [George Hotz](https://www.youtube.com/@geohotarchive)'s stream lately. Pretty Amazed by his skills and passion for programming and technology.

I want to be a guy like him(even he said don't try to be like him, try to be happy), So I search through the internet "How to be like George Hotz". Then I find a  [medium post](https://medium.com/@Satishes/how-to-become-like-george-hotz-6d282b60f068) which inspire me a lot

I find the modern zen poem which finds me a great path to learn or to find out which path I am trying to take

*To follow the path*  

*look to the master*  

*follow to the mast*er  

*walk with the mast*er  

*see through the ma*ster  

*become the master*  

Then i knew, if i want to become someone like geohot or have his skills, i have to follow his path.  
I have to have great passion and love for solving problems and the willing to explore the unsolved problems with a curiosity and **hacker**'s mind

As i mention **hacker**'s mind(or you can say hacker's throughts), i found a post [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)  

In this post, the author mentions *The Hacker Attitude*  

1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solvend.

2. No problem should ever have to be solvend twice.

3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.

4. Freedom is good.

5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.


the 1-4 indicate that hacker's are people who willing to solve the problems, exploring the unsolved problems' world

the 5 indicates that in order to become a hacker, you have to work hard  

That kind of attitude kinda hits me, I would love to live like that.  

To be fair, I'm not a passionate programmer, I want to explore the world of underwater, I want to dive into the caves and admire the beauty under 100m

However, I love to solve problems and find out the secret of human's brain or hack the simulation are all fascinating to me  

What i really want to do in the future in uncertain, but i'll try my best to follow the *master* and the hacker's attitude  

I might not end up of being a great programmer, but i really want to be someone with the *hacker's spirit*  

Remember the Modern Zen Poem

*To follow the path*  

*look to the master*  

*follow to the mast*e   

*walk with the mast*er  

*see through the ma*ster  

*become the master*
