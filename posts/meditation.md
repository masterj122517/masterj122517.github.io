# My Goal is to build a *model* that makes everyone can quickly learn a subject

My theory is: you got be interested in knowledge itself(or you can say thinking itself)

You have to train yourself to think all day. Therefore, you will be addicted to thinking itself

As the time pass, the current thinking ability couldn't fit your need, you will be eager to learn.

In this stage you are lock-in for sure.

So, how to force yourself to think all day, you must depend on tools like meditation.

Everybody have anxieties that come from life, work, etc.

Meditation will help you to be peace and calm.

I'm the kind of person who really become anxious about everything.

However, this is the first try out, If it doesn't work for me, that's fine.
